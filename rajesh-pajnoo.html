                    Market<sup>"</sup></p>
                    <p>
                        Since its launch in 2018, Truflo Pipes has made a significant mark for itself in the PVC pipes
market in India. The brand has revolutionised an 80-year-old industry by crafting high-quality
products that provide solutions to a number of customer requirements across sectors.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sharing his insights on the journey, Rajesh Pajnoo, CEO, Truflo Pipes says, “We took some
time to understand the route we should take to foray into the market. It’s a big industry and a
well-established one. Numerous companies including leading business houses have
ventured into this industry, in fact there have been players that didn&#39;t sustain. Therefore, we
decided to create differentiators.” The process of creating these differentiators began on the
shop floor for Rajesh and his team at Truflo, extending all the way to customer interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rajesh elaborates on their approach, stating “Our initial focus was on cultivating a distinct
environment and achieving manufacturing excellence. We created efficiency and first-of-its-
kind manufacturing plant in the country Our plant is fully automated from raw material to
finished product and there is very little manual intervention, reducing the chances of errors,
increasing efficiency, and leading to higher product consistency and quality.”

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>The Truflo plastic pipes and fittings manufacturing plant commenced operations in
                        Telangana in 2018 and has a Platinum rating from the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC).
                        Furthermore, it also holds GreenCo Platinum rating for its manufacturing processes, and
                        GreenPro certification for its CPVC pipes.
                    </p>
                    <p>To position a new entrant brand for success, Rajesh&#39;s business acumen played a pivotal role
                        in the strategic decision to launch with a comprehensive range, presenting an extensive
                        selection of over 2000 SKUs in the market. This approach aimed to distinguish the brand by
                        providing a wide array of products right from the start, setting a strong foundation for market
                        presence and customer appeal.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We decided to launch with over 90% of SKUs available in the market. So, when we
                        launched, it really gave us an edge as we had almost everything the market had to offer,”
                        shares Rajesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>Last but not the least, Truflo’s decision to set high benchmarks for itself resulted in it striving
                        to always achieve high quality – something that it has consistently done in the years since.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We decided to benchmark our product against the best in the industry. Through our
                        partnership with Sekisui Chemical Co. Ltd., which supplies NSF-certified Chlorinated
                        Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) compound known as Durastream, we have been able to deliver
                        top-quality piping solutions that cater to a diverse range of market requirements.&quot;
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, programs and schemes with plumbers and plumbing consultants created the
                        last mile outreach that was required for success. The result – Truflo created a new record by
                        becoming the first company in the history of this sector to touch a 1,00,000 plumber base in
                        one year!
                    </p>
                    <p>“We are among the approved brands in almost all leading projects in the country,” smiles
                        Rajesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>This growth for Truflo continues at a meteoric rate. Strong customer trust, a surge in new
                        orders, and repeat business have resulted in demand that has ushered in the need for
                        expansion of their manufacturing plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;In just our second year of operations, we successfully launched our second plant in
                        Hyderabad,&quot; Rajesh reveals. &quot;Currently, we have two, and we are in the process of setting
                        up another facility in Roorkee”.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even though manufacturing a pipe might not involve a lot of changes from a design
                        standpoint, Truflo has been successfully using automation to improve quality to even higher
                        grades.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The process of creating a pipe – the material mix, the formation etc. – is all being controlled
                        by SCADA. We can produce the best product, with the best quality. Design cannot be
                        changed much because they are governed by BIS norms which we adhere to strictly,” says
                        Rajesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even with manufacturing expansion, Truflo continues to remain committed to the
                        environment. Not just their plants, but also their manufacturing processes and products are
                        green rated. Truflo factories are completely ‘lead free’, over and above the compliance
                        needs issued by regulators.
                    </p>
                    <p>The innovation and growth doesn’t just come from the technology and processes that Truflo
                        is pioneering, but also from the culture that Rajesh drives within the organisation
                    </p>
                    <p>“If I am the CEO of this company, I believe that every guy – even my salesman – is also the
                        CEO. We have created an environment of empowerment. Everybody is empowered to take
                        the decisions at the right time,” says Rajesh. “Our decision-making process is swift, and
                        individuals from diverse backgrounds collaborate seamlessly, fostering a familial work
                        environment. Every single person is creating the success story of Truflo. That level of
                        emotion and involvement can be seen in all our plants and across offices.”
                    </p>
                    <p>We share a strong emotional connection within our team, so it&#39;s important to address our
                        team members&#39; feelings to create a positive work culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We always support each other and are always there for each other. This bond has grown
                        stronger after the Covid-19 pandemic,” smiles Rajesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>An example of this can be seen in the fact that Rajesh and other employees continued to be
                        at the plant at the height of Covid-19 pandemic taking care of employees who had fallen
                        sick. This instilled a sense of confidence in them that they would make it out of the
                        pandemic. An approachable CEO who is driving down a culture of empowerment has
                        resulted in Truflo having an industry-low attrition rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rajesh has always been close to the plastics and PVC sector through his career. Spending
                        around 20 years in capital machineries for plastics. Recognising a promising challenge,
                        Rajesh embraced his role at Truflo and has been thoroughly enjoying every step of the
                        journey.

                    </p>
                    <p>I saw an opportunity to leverage my expertise over here at Truflo to build something new.
                        The management and leadership team has been extremely supportive and have invested
                        significantly in us. They have also supported my decisions to help create a Truflo into the
                        market disruptor it is today.”
